            <p> 
                True!--nervous –dreadfully nervous, I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?  Hearken! And observe how calmly I can tell you the whole story.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object, there was none. I loved the old man. 
                For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture –a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, 
                my blood ran cold; and so, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
            </p>
            <p>
                You should have seen how wisely I proceeded. I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, 
                I turned the latch of his door and opened it –oh, so gently! I put in a dark lantern, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. I moved it slowly 
                –very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously so that a single thin ray 
                fell  upon the vulture eye. This I did for seven long nights.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves no more slowly than did mine. When I had waited a long time,
                very patiently, I resolved to open a very little crevice in the lantern, until, at length, a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot out and fell upon the
                vulture eye.
