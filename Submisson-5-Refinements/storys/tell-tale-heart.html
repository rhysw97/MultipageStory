                    <p> 
                        True!--nervous –dreadfully nervous, I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?  Hearken! And observe how calmly I can tell you the whole story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is impossible to say how first the idea entered my brain; but once conceived, it haunted me day and night. Object, there was none. I loved the old man. 
                        For his gold I had no desire. I think it was his eye! One of his eyes resembled that of a vulture –a pale blue eye, with a film over it. Whenever it fell upon me, 
                        my blood ran cold; and so, I made up my mind to take the life of the old man, and thus rid myself of the eye forever.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You should have seen how wisely I proceeded. I was never kinder to the old man than during the whole week before I killed him. And every night, about midnight, 
                        I turned the latch of his door and opened it –oh, so gently! I put in a dark lantern, so that no light shone out, and then I thrust in my head. I moved it slowly 
                        –very slowly, so that I might not disturb the old man’s sleep. And then, when my head was well in the room, I undid the lantern cautiously so that a single thin ray 
                        fell  upon the vulture eye. This I did for seven long nights.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Upon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious in opening the door. A watch’s minute hand moves no more slowly than did mine. When I had waited a long time,
                        very patiently, I resolved to open a very little crevice in the lantern, until, at length, a single dim ray, like the thread of the spider, shot out and fell upon the
                        vulture eye.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        It was open –wide open –and I grew furious as I gazed upon it! A dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones. Now, There came 
                        to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It increased my fury, 
                        as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A new anxiety seized me –the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. 
                        He shrieked once –once only.  In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled 
                        sound. At length it ceased. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. The old man was dead! His eye would trouble me no more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. First, I dismembered the corpse. 
                        I cut off the head and the arms and the legs
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Next, I took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly that no human eye 
                    – not even his – could have detected anything wrong.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        It was four o’clock – still dark a midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,
                        for what had I to fear? There entered three men, officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night, suspicion of foul play had 
                        been aroused, and the officers had been deputed to search the premises.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house 
                        and bade them search – search well.  I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, 
                        I brought chairs into the room, and desired them to rest from their fatigue, while I myself, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse 
                        of the victim.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The officers were satisfied.  They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.
                        I fancied a ringing in my ears. I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling, but in continued –until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased. It was a  low, dull, quick sound – such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
                        I paced the floor, but the noise steadily increased. Oh, God! What could I do? I foamed – I raved – I swore! But the noise arose over all. 
                        It grew louder – louder – louder! Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! No, no! They heard! They suspected! They knew! They were making a mockery of my horror!
                        I felt that I must scream or die! And now, again! Hark! <strong>Louder! Louder! Louder!</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>"Villains!”</em> I shrieked, <em>“dissemble no more! I admit the deed! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It is the beating of his hideous heart!”</em>
                    </p>
