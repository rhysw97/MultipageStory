                I bade the gentlemen welcome. The shriek, I said, was my own in a dream. The old man, I mentioned, was absent in the country. I took my visitors all over the house 
                and bade them search – search well.  I led them, at length, to his chamber. I showed them his treasures, secure, undisturbed. In the enthusiasm of my confidence, 
                I brought chairs into the room, and desired them to rest from their fatigue, while I myself, placed my own seat upon the very spot beneath which reposed the corpse 
                of the victim.

                The officers were satisfied.  They sat, and while I answered cheerily, they chatted of familiar things.  But, ere long, I felt myself getting pale and wished them gone.
                I fancied a ringing in my ears. I talked more freely to get rid of the feeling, but in continued –until, at length, I found that the noise was not within my ears.

                I talked more fluently, and with a heightened voice. Yet the sound increased. It was a  low, dull, quick sound – such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton.
                I paced the floor, but the noise steadily increased. Oh, God! What could I do? I foamed – I raved – I swore! But the noise arose over all. 
                It grew louder – louder – louder! Was it possible they heard not? Almighty God! No, no! They heard! They suspected! They knew! They were making a mockery of my horror!
                I felt that I must scream or die! And now, again! Hark! <strong>Louder! Louder! Louder!</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>"Villains!”</em> I shrieked, <em>“dissemble no more! I admit the deed! Tear up the planks! Here, here! It is the beating of his hideous heart!”</em>
