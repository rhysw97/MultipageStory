                It was open –wide open –and I grew furious as I gazed upon it! A dull blue, with a hideous veil over it that chilled the very marrow in my bones. Now, There came 
                to my ears a low, dull, quick sound, such as a watch makes when enveloped in cotton. It was the beating of the old man’s heart. It increased my fury, 
                as the beating of a drum stimulates the soldier into courage.

                A new anxiety seized me –the sound would be heard by a neighbor! The old man’s hour had come! With a loud yell, I threw open the lantern and leaped into the room. 
                He shrieked once –once only.  In an instant I dragged him to the floor, and pulled the heavy bed over him. But, for many minutes, the heart beat on with a muffled 
                sound. At length it ceased. I removed the bed and examined the corpse. The old man was dead! His eye would trouble me no more.

            <p>
                If still you think me mad, you will think so no longer when I describe the wise precautions I took for the concealment of the body. First, I dismembered the corpse. 
                I cut off the head and the arms and the legs
            </p>
            <p>
               Next, I took up three planks from the flooring of the chamber, and deposited all between the scantlings. I then replaced the boards so cleverly that no human eye 
               – not even his – could have detected anything wrong.
            </p>
            <p> 
                It was four o’clock – still dark a midnight. As the bell sounded the hour, there came a knocking at the street door. I went down to open it with a light heart,
                for what had I to fear? There entered three men, officers of the police. A shriek had been heard by a neighbor during the night, suspicion of foul play had 
                been aroused, and the officers had been deputed to search the premises.
